# Foucault-Unmasked
Software for analyzing Foucault images of a mirror without the use of a mask.

  This software will analyze foucault images of a mirror and produce information about the mirror's surface, including a profile and Strehl ratio.
  To use the software you need to photogragh foucault images of your mirror (withouut the use of a mask). An image is required for each zone you want to include in the analysis. Generally it's easyist if you start with the central zone and then move the knife edge by a fixed amount for each subsequent zone until you reach the edge zone.  The more zones you photogragh, the more detailed the results will be.
